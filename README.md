# Dotfiles (linux)

This collection is based on my own [dotfiles collection](https://github.com/vhugo/dotfiles), which I mostly use for my mac development environment. Recently, I wanted something similar with smaller footprint and more compatiable with linux systems. These are configurations for prompt customization, vim and git.
